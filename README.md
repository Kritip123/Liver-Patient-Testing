# Liver-Patient-Testing
A classification algorithm used in machine learning. Random Forest Classifier is used in it. It belongs to the supervised learning domain and finds intense application in pattern recognition, data mining and intrusion detection.
# Dataset
This file contains data about various test samples - their age, gender, total Bilirubin, direct Bilirubin, total proteins, albumin, A/G ratio, SGPT, SGOT and Alkphos and indicates if the test sample is a liver patient or not.
# Model
This is a classification model is trained to predict if the patient is liver patient or not. It takes salient features to predict the required.
# Requirements
-->python 3.7 -->pandas -->sklearn -->numpy -->matplotlib
